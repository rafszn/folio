      <p>
        As a software engineer, my journey began with a fascination for
        understanding how games, apps, and websites work behind the scenes. This
        curiosity led me to immerse myself in technologies like React, Express,
        Node.js, and MongoDBâ€”tools that I now love to work with. Recently, I had
        the opportunity to work on a challenging project where I <i>scraped</i>{" "}
        data from over seven different sites, extracting valuable insights and
        offers.

        The excitement I feel when solving problems through code is unmatched;
        it brings me a profound sense of happiness and fulfillment. I'm
        passionate about exploring all areas of technology and have big
        aspirations for the future, one of my goals being to develop innovative
        solutions to real-world problems.
